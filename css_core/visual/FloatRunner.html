		 * 	float:take an element out of the flow and place it to the left or right of other elements in the same parent element.
		 *  a floated element is first laid out according to the normal flow, then removed from the normal flow.
		 * 
		 *  float value:
		 *  left: move to the left-most boundary of its parent element
		 *   
		 *  clear value
		 *  left: the top edge of this element must sit below any element that has the float: left property applied to it
		 *  (brings the elements following any floated elements back into the normal flow)
		 * 
		 *  float collapsing: floated elements are originally calculated in the normal flow and then removed, 
		 *  the parent element doesn’t consider it within its bounds and therefore acts as if it isn’t even there.
