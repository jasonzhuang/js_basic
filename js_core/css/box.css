/**
 * The height and width properties assign a height and width to the <bold>content</bold> area of a style
 *
 * CSS rules require setting the width for floated elements for all tags except images
 * 
 * The clear property instructs an element to not wrap around a floated item
 * 
 * float has the added benefit of letting you set a width and force elements that follow the style to wrap around it
